Personal Note after this build:

1. Based on the routing function in werkzeug, Flask enhance it to offer it's own
   @route(url, endpoint), much more easy for end users.

2. User could use the request and response in more elgant ways, without handle
   the HTTP headers and so on ...

3. From this example, we could know it's won't be to complicate to create a
   framwork(simple of course) with WSGI lib. Flask is still big one for me.

4. Any necessary to check the source code of Werkzeug ? Maybe yes...
